## About me

I'm a software engineer with experience in healthcare and emergency management who loves learning and solving problems. I felt drawn in a new direction and have jumped in with both feet into the world of software engineering. I graduated Flatiron School's software engineering program in July of 2022 where I learned about full stack software development with JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails. 

Since then I've been looking for an opportunity to apply my skills to real world problems, and studying: expanding my knowledge of familiar topics, learning data structures and algorithms, practicing with new languages like TypeScript and Flutter. 

When I am not coding I enjoy Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and wrestling, mountain biking, or playing beach volleyball with friends.  If you have role you think I'd be a good fit for or simply want to connect don't hesitate to connect with me.
